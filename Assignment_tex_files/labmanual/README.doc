This directory contains a working copy of the manual for the practical course.

The sources of the manual have been put under cvs in
"/opt/stud/robotics/assistance/cvsroot/handleiding".

Do a "cvs status" to see if this working copy is up to date.

See
/opt/stud/robotics/assistance/README.CVS for more information on using cvs.

The manual is written in LaTeX2e.

The figures of the manual are in the images subdirectory.

File description:
zsbmanual.tex             The manual in LaTeX2e 
task1.tex			   Link to ../chess_engine/content.tex
images/                   The figures of the manual
TODO                      Like always, there are still a few things to do
                          regarding the manual
Makefile                  Makes compiling the Latex-code (somewhat) easier

I have put versions of the manual as used in previous years in
"/opt/stud/robotics/assistance/handleiding/formerCourses/".
These older manuals are not put under CVS! (too much space)

-----------------------------------

Before you could make zsbmanual.pdf, you should first make a connection to the content of ../chess_engine by performing the command:

  $ ln ../chess_engine/content.tex task1.tex

The Makefile is added for convenience.
You can now make a ps or pdf by running:

  $ make ps
  $ make pdf

Or (if latex was only run once or you want to force a rebuild):

  $ make new ps
  $ make new pdf

Happy Making
